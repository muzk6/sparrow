# Xdebug Trace Tree

This is a simple PHP script to display [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org) traces in a tree like visualization. It can collapse parts
that you're not interested in when analysing the trace, making it much easier to follow the program flow.

Installation is simple. Just clone this dierectory to somewhere in your webserver and it should automatically
list all available trace files.

**Important:** this is meant a personal debugging - it should not be installed on a public webserver (Its passing
full file paths).
